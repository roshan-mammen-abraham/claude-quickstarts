| Agents                   | Python                  | Minimal educational agent implementation (<300 lines)|

Key Characteristics
-------------------

- Copy-paste ready: Each project can serve as a starting point for custom applications
- Multi-model support: Works with Claude Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus 4.5
- Production patterns: Docker containerization, deployment guides, security considerations
- Well-documented: Comprehensive READMEs and setup instructions

Tech Stack
----------

- Python projects: Use ruff for linting, pyright for types, pytest for testing
- TypeScript projects: Next.js with shadcn/ui components, ESLint, strict mode

The repository is actively maintained, with recent additions including the browser-use-demo and autonomous coding agent quickstarts.

ENTRY 2: Project Evaluations & Recommendations
================================================================================

1. agents/ - Minimal Agent Reference
------------------------------------
Purpose:    Educational implementation showing how to build LLM agents
Stack:      Python, Anthropic SDK, MCP
Complexity: Low (~300 lines of core code)
Setup:      Simple - just Python + API key

Pros: Minimal, easy to understand, demonstrates core patterns (tool loops, MCP integration)
Cons: Not production-ready, limited features by design


2. autonomous-coding/ - Multi-Session Autonomous Dev
----------------------------------------------------
Purpose:    Long-running autonomous coding over multiple sessions
Stack:      Python, Claude Agent SDK, Claude Code CLI
Complexity: Medium
Setup:      Requires Claude Code CLI + SDK

Pros: Two-agent pattern, security sandbox, progress persistence via git
Cons: Takes a long time to run (hours for full app), requires CLI installation


3. browser-use-demo/ - Browser Automation
-----------------------------------------
Purpose:    Web browser automation with DOM-based element targeting
Stack:      Python, Playwright, Streamlit, Docker
Complexity: Medium-High
Setup:      Docker required

Pros: Reliable element targeting (not pixel-based), web-specific actions, good architecture
Cons: Docker dependency, CAPTCHAs can block Google searches


4. computer-use-demo/ - Full Desktop Control
--------------------------------------------
Purpose:    Claude controlling a full desktop environment
Stack:      Python, Streamlit, Docker, VNC
Complexity: High
Setup:      Docker required, multi-provider support (Anthropic/Bedrock/Vertex)

Pros: Full desktop control, multi-API provider support, comprehensive tooling
Cons: Complex setup, resource-heavy, beta feature with unique risks


5. customer-support-agent/ - RAG-Powered Support Chat
-----------------------------------------------------
Purpose:    Customer support chatbot with knowledge base retrieval
Stack:      Next.js, TypeScript, React, shadcn/ui, AWS Bedrock
Complexity: Medium
Setup:      npm + AWS credentials + Bedrock KB setup

Pros: Production-like patterns, customizable UI, RAG integration, AWS Amplify deployment
Cons: Requires AWS account and Bedrock KB setup


6. financial-data-analyst/ - Data Visualization Chat
----------------------------------------------------
Purpose:    Chat-based data analysis with dynamic chart generation
Stack:      Next.js, TypeScript, Recharts, TailwindCSS
Complexity: Low-Medium
Setup:      Simple - just npm + API key

Pros: Visual output, file upload support (PDF, CSV, images), multiple chart types, versatile
Cons: Limited to data visualization tasks


Recommendation for Claude Code Exploration
------------------------------------------

Best choice: agents/

Why:
1. Simplest to understand - Core logic is <300 lines, deliberately minimal
2. Fastest setup - Just Python + API key, no Docker or AWS needed
3. Excellent learning foundation - Shows the fundamental agent loop pattern
4. Extensible - Easy to add tools, experiment with MCP servers
5. Well-suited for Claude Code - Small codebase means quick understanding and modification

Second choice: financial-data-analyst/

If you prefer a more complete application with visual output:
- Simple setup (npm + API key)
- Immediate visual feedback with charts
- Good for learning Next.js + Claude integration patterns

Avoid starting with: computer-use-demo or browser-use-demo unless you specifically want
to explore computer/browser automation - they require Docker and have more moving parts.

ENTRY 3: CLAUDE.md Improvements
================================================================================

Updated CLAUDE.md with the following changes:

1. Added required header with Claude Code guidance text
2. Added repository overview explaining the monorepo structure (independent projects, no shared code)
3. Added missing projects:
   - agents/ (Python, minimal agent reference)
   - browser-use-demo/ (Python/Docker/Playwright)
   - autonomous-coding/ (Python/Claude Agent SDK)
4. Added architecture notes for each project showing key file relationships:
   - computer-use-demo: loop.py → tools/ → streamlit.py
   - browser-use-demo: browser.py → loop.py → streamlit.py + browser_tool_utils/
   - agents: agent.py → tools/ → utils/
   - autonomous-coding: two-agent pattern with feature_list.json persistence
5. Consolidated code style into a single section at the end
6. Made commands more scannable with inline comments
